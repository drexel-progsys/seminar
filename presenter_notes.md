There are two sides of presenting:

- Getting things on the screen for the room
- Getting things on screen for folks in Zoom (if Zoom is involved)

## Presenting in 928 or any other CCI classroom

All CCI classrooms have the same A/V setup, aside from 928 having a large display and other classrooms having screens. If you plug in your laptop, you'll get an external display, but the room's A/V system will usually show *two* screens,
side by side: your external display, and the display for the machine in the room. For help getting your laptop connected and showing on the big monitor,
see the general A/V support docs from CCI, which have some pictorals to show you what to select: https://support.cci.drexel.edu/cci-spaces/classroom-av-systems/cci-classroom-technology-and-cynap-use-3675-market-street/

If we end up in another classroom, the screen will almost certainly already be down. On the off chance that it's not, the little screen next to the podium screen has controls to turn on the projector and lower the screen; see the CCI A/V support docs above if you can't find those settings.

## Presenting on Zoom

If you're also sharing your presentation to zoom, you need to do several additional things:

- *Before* you set up your laptop, sign into the physical machine at the podium.
  + Once logged in, sign into Zoom *on the podium machine* and join the Zoom meeting.
  + You should get the room camera and microphone. If you don't, contact ihelp, as someone probably unplugged something
- Set up your laptop as above
- Sign into Zoom on your laptop and join the meeting there (you'll now be signed into the Zoom twice, from two machines, in the same meeting twice)
- On you laptop only, click the little up-arrow thingy by the microphone icon in Zoom, and choose "Leave Computer Audio." This way the only audio from the room will come from the room's microphone (via the podium machine).
- Share the *entire screen* for the *external display* into Zoom.
  + If you don't share the entire screen, we won't see any slides in presentation / full-screen mode
  + If you share your built-in laptop screen instead of the external screen, people on Zoom will see your "presenter view" with notes, next slides, etc.
 
It is recommended to check that you're sharing the correct screen before getting into the presentation.
